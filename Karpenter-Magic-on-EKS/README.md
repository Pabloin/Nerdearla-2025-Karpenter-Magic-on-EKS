Now I understand the situation! Karpenter is not installed yet, but there's already a NodePool configuration. This is the perfect setup - you have a clean production cluster ready for Karpenter installation.

Would you like me to:

1. Install Karpenter on your production cluster
2. Configure the IAM roles properly
3. Set up NodePools for automatic scaling

This will give you the full "Karpenter magic" ðŸ§Šâœ¨!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŽ¯ What Should Happen (The Karpenter Magic):
When properly configured, here's the win:

You deploy a workload â†’ Kubernetes tries to schedule it
No nodes available? â†’ Karpenter sees this
Karpenter automatically launches EC2 instances â†’ Based on your NodePool requirements
Workload gets scheduled â†’ On the new nodes
Workload finishes? â†’ Karpenter terminates unused nodes (saves money! ðŸ’°)
Let me show you what we need to fix:

Created KARPENTER_STATUS.md

TL;DR: Your NodePool is like a perfectly written recipe, but there's no chef (Karpenter controller) to cook the meal (launch EC2 instances)!

Would you like me to install the "chef" (Karpenter) so your cluster can actually auto-scale? ðŸ§Šâœ¨
